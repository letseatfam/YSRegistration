Yeezy Supply Account Registration

Script is from:
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/39272-yeezy-supply-registration

I do not own or maintain script.  I am simply saving here for back-up purposes.

I have created a YouTube video on how to run the script on both Chrome and Safari browsers:

First, open the .js file and copy the script to your clipboard (you can exclude the first few lines of comments)

Next, go to:
https://yeezysupply.com/account/register

Google Chrome Users
Right-click on the page after it loads, then click on "Inspect"
Access the Javascript Console by clicking on the "Console" tab at the top of the window
Paste the script in the console and hit Enter
Close the console and enter your user information (first/last name, email, password) and click "Submit"
If prompted, solve the captcha

You should receive an email asking you to confirm your registration.  Click the link in the email and re-enter your email and password and click "Submit"

Finally, to login to your account go to:
